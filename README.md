# Image Captioning Model

This repository implements an image captioning model that generates textual descriptions for images using deep learning techniques. The project extracts features from images using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) and stores the features for further caption generation.

## Features

- **Pre-trained CNN Model**: Utilizes a CNN such as VGG16 to extract image features.
- **Feature Storage**: Extracted features are stored using Python's `pickle` module for future caption generation.
- **Image Preprocessing**: The images are resized and normalized before being passed through the CNN model.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pillow (for image processing)
- Pickle (for serializing features)

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow
